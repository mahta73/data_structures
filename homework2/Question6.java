/*
    (a) (5 points) Modify the insertion sort algorithm by replacing the main loop with
    recursion. Test your method properly by using it in a program.

    (b) (5 points) Modify the quick-sort algorithm to rely on a randomly chosen pivot.
    Test your method properly by using it in a program.

    (c) (5 points) Give an example input of length 10 on which merge-sort runs in O(n log n)
    time, insertion sort runs in O(n) time, and quick-sort (where the pivot is the last
    element) runs in O(n^2) time to sort in non-decreasing order of elements. Illustrate
    all three sorting algorithms for that example. Specify the running times of all three
    algorithms on the reverse of your example.
